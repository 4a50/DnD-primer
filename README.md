## User Stories

### User story 1

As a user I would like to be able to play through different guided scenarios so that I know what kinds of decision can be made in the game. As someone who has no experience playing DnD, I would like this app to be very beginner friendly. I would like an introduction to the game, easy to understand instructions and on each level of the game and I would like to have a "help" button or "tips" section readily available if I get stuck. The goal of this application is so people who have never played DnD before can feel like they were able to learn enough about the basic fundamentals of the game to start playing with others!
